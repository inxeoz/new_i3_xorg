Connection Failed: No audio endpoints registered bluetooth arch linux
ChatGPT said:

If you're getting the error "Connection Failed: No audio endpoints registered" on Arch Linux with Bluetooth audio devices, it typically means that PulseAudio (or PipeWire, depending on what you're using) isn't properly recognizing or configuring the Bluetooth audio profile.

Here‚Äôs a checklist of things to check and steps to fix it:
üîß 1. Are you using PulseAudio or PipeWire?

Check which audio system you're using:

pactl info

If the server name contains PulseAudio, you're using PulseAudio. If it mentions PipeWire, then you're on PipeWire.
üëâ If you're using PipeWire (modern default):
‚úÖ Make sure the following packages are installed:

sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-audio pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa wireplumber

Also, for Bluetooth support:

sudo pacman -S pipewire-bluetooth

Then restart your system or restart PipeWire services:

systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber

üëâ If you're using PulseAudio:
‚úÖ Install Bluetooth support for PulseAudio:

sudo pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-bluetooth

Then restart PulseAudio:

pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start

üéß Additional Steps
1. Check Bluetooth service

Ensure the Bluetooth daemon is running:

sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth

2. Use bluetoothctl to connect properly

    Start interactive mode:

bluetoothctl

Pair, trust, and connect:

    power on
    agent on
    default-agent
    scan on
    pair <device-mac>
    trust <device-mac>
    connect <device-mac>

    Then set the correct profile (usually A2DP):

Use pavucontrol or this command to switch to A2DP:

pactl set-card-profile bluez_card.<mac> a2dp_sink

Replace <mac> with your device‚Äôs MAC address format (like XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX).
3. Use pavucontrol (PulseAudio Volume Control)

Install and open it:

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
pavucontrol

Go to the "Configuration" tab, and make sure the Bluetooth device is set to A2DP.
üß† Still not working?

Let me know:

    Are you using PipeWire or PulseAudio?

    Which Bluetooth headset/device are you trying to connect?

    Output of: pactl list cards, bluetoothctl devices, or journalctl -xe | grep bluetooth

We can dig deeper from there.

Got it! You're using Blueman (blueman-applet & blueman-manager) as your Bluetooth GUI, which typically works alongside BlueZ and either PulseAudio or PipeWire for Bluetooth audio.

To fix the "No audio endpoints registered" issue when using Blueman, here's a targeted checklist for your setup:
üîé 1. Figure Out: Are You on PipeWire or PulseAudio?

Run:

pactl info

Look for the Server Name:

    PulseAudio ‚Üí You‚Äôre using PulseAudio

    PipeWire ‚Üí You‚Äôre using PipeWire

Let me know what it says if you're not sure.
üõ†Ô∏è 2. Fix for PipeWire Setup (most modern Arch installs)

If you're using PipeWire, make sure these are installed:

sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa pipewire-bluetooth wireplumber

Then restart the services:

systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber

You may also reboot to apply everything cleanly.
üõ†Ô∏è 3. Fix for PulseAudio Setup

If pactl info shows you're using PulseAudio:

Install required modules:

sudo pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-bluetooth

Restart PulseAudio:

pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start

Make sure the module is loaded:

pactl list modules | grep bluetooth

If it's not, load it manually:

pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

To make that permanent, add this line to your ~/.config/pulse/default.pa:

load-module module-bluetooth-discover

üéß 4. After Connecting in Blueman...

Even if Blueman connects successfully, the audio profile might not switch automatically.

Run this to check the audio profile:

pactl list cards | grep -A 20 'bluez_card'

Look for something like Profiles: and check if it's using a2dp_sink. If it's on headset_head_unit or off, that‚Äôs your problem.

Switch manually:

pactl set-card-profile bluez_card.MAC_ADDRESS a2dp_sink

(Use underscores _ instead of colons : in the MAC address.)
üí° Bonus: Use pavucontrol to Make It Easier

Install and launch:

sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
pavucontrol

Go to Configuration tab ‚Üí Select A2DP profile for your Bluetooth device.
‚ùì If It's Still Broken:

Please share output from:

    pactl info

    pactl list cards

    bluetoothctl paired-devices

    journalctl -xe | grep blue

That‚Äôll help pinpoint what‚Äôs going wrong.
